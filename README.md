# Smart Task Tracker

A production-style backend system that enables natural language task management while enforcing strict server-side validation, policy control, and full auditability.

The LLM acts only as a planner. It suggests structured tool calls, while the backend validates, authorizes, executes, and logs all operations.

---

## Key Features

- Natural language to structured task execution using LLM tool calling
- Server-side validation and policy enforcement (no direct LLM writes to database)
- Role-based access control (employee, manager, admin)
- Full audit logging of all AI-driven actions
- Hybrid architecture combining REST API, AI orchestration, and Slack integration
- Insights engine for productivity, priorities, and anomalies
- Async-ready design prepared for queues and worker-based scaling

---

## Architecture

User Input (REST / Slack / Chat)
→ LLM Planner (tool suggestions only)
→ Validation Layer (schema validation + policy checks)
→ Execution Engine (safe database operations)
→ Audit Logger
→ Response (API or Slack reply)

Core principle:
The model suggests, the system decides.

## Tech Stack

- Backend: FastAPI (Python)
- Frontend: React (optional UI)
- Authentication: JWT
- Database: SQLite (extendable to PostgreSQL)
- AI: OpenAI tool calling (optional via API key)
- Async: Background tasks (queue-ready design)
- Integrations: Slack Events API

---

## Core Modules

### Task System (REST API)

- Create, read, update, delete tasks
- Filtering by status, due date, and priority
- Enforced ownership and permission rules in backend

---

### LLM Orchestration (/chat)

- Converts natural language into structured tool calls
- Validates and executes only allowed actions
- Handles clarification flows when needed
- Returns structured responses with audit IDs

---

### Slack Integration

- Real-time Slack event processing
- Request signature verification for security
- Role-based tool exposure per user
- Full traceability for every Slack interaction

---

### Insights Engine

- Productivity tracking (completion patterns, delays)
- Priority analysis (overdue and high-risk tasks)
- Anomaly detection across user behavior
- Next-action recommendations

---

### Demo System

- Pre-seeded scenarios for testing and demos
- Role-based dashboards (manager, analyst, executive)
- Resettable environment for presentations

---

## Design Principles

- Zero-trust execution of LLM outputs
- Strict separation of planning and execution
- Full auditability of all AI actions
- Failure-safe design with fallback handling
- Extensible architecture for queues, workers, and microservices

---

## What Makes This System Different

Unlike typical LLM wrapper applications:

- The LLM cannot directly modify data
- Every action is validated before execution
- All AI decisions are logged and traceable
- The system treats AI as a planner, not an executor
- Built with production failure modes in mind

---

## Future Improvements

- Add Redis caching and rate limiting
- Move execution layer to RabbitMQ worker system
- Add Prometheus and Grafana observability
- Expand evaluation suite for LLM tool accuracy
- Deploy full production demo (API + frontend)

---

## Setup

```bash
python -m venv .venv
